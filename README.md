## Mission

Tilt's mission is to map every theme to a basket of stocks for anyone to invest in. Mappings are AI generated and expert curated.
Expert improvements are accepted if they provide a better representation of a given theme.

## Theme Prompt
<!--[[[cog
import cog
import json
with open('config.json') as file:
  config = json.load(file)
  cog.outl(config['prompt'])
]]]-->
Inflation will persist globally as governments solve any problem by printing money. Commodities, land, real estate, and companies with monopolistic positions enabling pricing power stand to benefit.
